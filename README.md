# SpectrumPlotter
This software was developed for a custom LIBS setup shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C7Hajgg9nU
It was required to trigger the sampling upon an event, which was implemented using a photodiode connected to the trigger pin GPIO C13

# Firmware
The required firmware is at https://github.com/g3gg0/tcd1304-advanced.
This version is based on the firmware from https://tcd1304.wordpress.com/the-firmware/ but adds a triggering feature.
